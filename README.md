<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Geo!</h1>



### A little bit about me
Hello World! My name is Giancarlo but my friends call me Geo. I'm a full-stack engineer focused on the MERN stack. I'm very business oriented and love proving business ideas can work. I have succesfully made money (don't tell the VCs) and delivered client satisfaction with a clothing business, SEO business and web development business (I still do this). The journey never ends and I look forward to it everyday.

### Past Work

I've had the pleasure to work with small web shops all the way to 9 figure businesses. I've had roles in making sure a button color is just right, to ensuring that software architecture could handle around 8 figures in daily users. While it was hard work, fortunately nothing ever blew up in our face.
