### A little bit about me
Hello World! My name is Geo. I'm a full-stack engineer.

### Past Work

I've had the pleasure to work with small web shops all the way to 9 figure businesses. I've had roles in making sure a button color is just right, to ensuring that software architecture could handle around 8 figures in daily users. While it was hard work, fortunately nothing ever blew up in our face.
